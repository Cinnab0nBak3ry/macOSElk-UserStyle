## Why? ðŸ¤”

I used to browse Twitter on my Mac near-exclusively through it's application. Switching from Twitter to Mastodon really kicked my second nature in the shins, but luckily [Elk.zone](https://elk.zone/) was announced months later, which looks just like the Twitter website. Bad-ass. 

One bored day, I thought that it would be cool if this website looked more like the Twitter application, because I kinda miss using it. So here we are! 

## Enough backstory, give me the thingy! ðŸ“¥

* Install by pressing "Install with Stylus" see look it says that --> [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-stylus-006666?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/SlippingGitty/macOSElk/raw/main/macOSElk.user.css)

* Also install on [userstyles.world](https://userstyles.world/style/8294/macos-elk)

## FireFox Users
Stylus users on Firefox have to be on version 102 or later and toggle "Patch CSP to allow style assets".  
  Chromium browsers shall be fine by default on any recent version.

### Looking for this?
* This is a *userstyle*, an add on for the elk.zone website, and should not be confused with the Native application of elk.zone made by the Elk Team.
